Client(client_id="", clean_session=True, userdata=None, protocol=MQTTv311, transport="tcp")
#client_id = preset or randomly generated if blank
#clean_session = keep or detele client information if there is a disconnect
#userdata = user defined data type of payload, user_set_data can change this later
#protocall = what type of protocol will be used

#host = host IP
#port = host port
#keep alive = time in seconds between sending data?
#bind_address = the IP of a local network interface to bind the client to
client.publish(topic, payload=None, qos=0, retain=False)      #sends message from client to broker
#topic = topci name
#payload = data
#qos = quality of service level to used
#retain = if set to true, the message will be set as the last known successful message 
###returns a MQTTMessageInfo datatype which expose a few attributes about the message
subscribe(topic, qos=0)      #subscribe the cient to a topic
#topic = topic name
#qos = quality of service level, default = 0

#####USE THIS TO GET THE ORIGINAL THRESHOLDS FOR THAT NODE####
#client = client instance for the callback
#userdata = private user data set on initialization
#mid = value returned from the subscribe() call above
#granted_qos = the qos that the broker has alloted for the client
